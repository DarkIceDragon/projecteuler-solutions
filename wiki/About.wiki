#summary About projecteuler-solutions

===What is projecteuler-solutions?===

As the name suggests, projecteuler-solutions is a collection of solutions for site Project Euler, which is a collection of math and programming related problems. You can find Project Euler at (<a href="http://projecteuler.net">http://projecteuler.net</a>). This site aims to provide complete and accurate solution listings for Project Euler.

===What is the purpose of this site?===

After you struggle for hours or days on a difficult problem, you may eventually give up (after all, the world would be a strange place if people never gave up on a problem). At this point, you have two options:

  * Without a solution, you leave feeling frustrated and you feel as if all your effort had been for nothing. With no way to check the right answer, you don't know how close you were to the solution, where you had gone wrong, etc. In the end, you have learned nothing, leaving without even the gratification of having figured out the problem.

  * With a solution, you can compare your method with the correct solution, perhaps figure out what you did wrong. Alternatively, you can peek at the solution as a sort of 'hint' -- that is, knowing the solver's general approach, figure out the details of his solution, then code the solution yourself. Either way, you have gained from this problem -- as much as you would have gained had you solved the problem completely independently.

In the end, the purpose of Project Euler isn't to compete for rankings. The main purpose of the activity is to learn and improve yourself in a challenging and fun way. If you need to 'cheat' in order to learn from and enjoy the problems, so be it.

This website does not provide solutions or code for individual problems; rather, it simply provides individual numerical answers to the problems. With the numerical answers, you have access to the official forums, in which you can access dozens of solutions in numerous different programming languages, often using several very different approaches. By unlocking this valuable resource for you, Projecteuler-solutions hopes you will be able to get more out of Project Euler..

===What about cheating?===

It is, of course, possible to abuse these solutions and simply paste solutions one by one to gain ranks. This is rather pointless, as doing so will gain you nothing. Also, accounts doing this will be removed quickly. With the CAPTCHA system introduced in an update, it is no longer possible to facilitate this by using an automated program to submit solutions.

===How did I obtain these solutions?===

Most of the solutions were obtained from somewhere on the Internet. No other site has the solutions to the entire set of 250+ problems. Also, some solutions were contributed by users of this site.

===Why are some solutions wrong?===

All solutions here have been tested at least once, but it is not impossible that a mistake might occur. Occasionally, some problem parameters change. Why, I don't know. In that case I will fix it when I find out about it, whenever that may be.
